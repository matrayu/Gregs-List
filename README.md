You're the product engineer on a v1 (version one) prototype for Greg's List, an old-school classified ads site. Gregslist intends to first do as well as their main competitor, Craigslist, and in later releases to do better. For the upcoming product meeting, you're expected to provide a v1 of an HTML/CSS implementation of the search result page for Gregslist (see designs and requirements below). Your v1 should be as polished as possible so that you leave a good impression on your teammates.

Requirements
You are building a search results page as represented in the designs found below this list of requirements. For the prototype you'll demo to your team, you'll provide results to a user search for software jobs.

Reasonable but not pixel perfect implementation of the designs provided below.
For each result item, use the same element structure and classes. In other words, you should only have to write style rules once for a search result item, and then use the same class on each individual search item. Feel free to repeat the text between search items, but try to get titles of different lengths so you can see how it impacts your layout.
The design calls for a magnifying glass icon. Use this image file (whose URL you can copy by right-clicking and selecting "Copy Image Address"):

Include a page title (aka, use a <title> element) and meta description in the head.
Put the <input> and the element with the magnifying glass in a common <form> element.
Use semantic HTML throughout the page. Take special care on that magnifying glass: are <img> elements meant to be interactive? How can you make a semantic image-like button? Do some Googling!
Create your work using repl.it, saving it as you go.
Submit a link to your project below to let your mentor know it's time to review your code.
Don't waste your time looking at how Craiglist (your competitor!) coded up their site, as it doesn't follow best practices.
